Readme for XChat LastFM Plugin
============ 

A Last.FM XChat Now playing script - /np perl script for xchat 
Usage: 
1. Set last fm user and rss feed in lastfm.pl 
2.Load the plugin in XChat or HexChat (For hexchat put in your appdata in a folder named addons for autoload) 
3. Type /np where you would like the song to be announced :) 

Enjoy 

This script is a modification of Phil84's script. 
The most noticeable change is that my modification only posts the current song, Phil's posts the last 10.
